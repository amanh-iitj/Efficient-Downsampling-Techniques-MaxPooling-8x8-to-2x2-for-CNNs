# Efficient-Downsampling-Techniques-MaxPooling-8x8-to-2x2-for-CNNs


## Introduction

- This project explores efficient downsampling technique in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using MaxPooling to transform an 8x8 matrix into a 2x2 matrix. Implemented entirely in Verilog, the goal is to enhance 
the performance and efficiency of CNNs by reducing computational complexity while preserving essential features.


## Background

- MaxPooling is a popular downsampling technique in CNNs, widely used to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps. By selecting the maximum value within a defined window, MaxPooling helps in achieving translation invariance and reducing overfitting. This project specifically focuses on transforming an 8x8 matrix into a 2x2 matrix using MaxPooling.



## Design

- Input here is a 8x 8 matrix that can be thought of as a collection of four 4 x 4 submatrices or sixteen 2x2 submatrices . When you apply the first 2 x 2 max-pooling, you basically obtain a 4x4 matrix which when again filtered with 2x2 max-pooling yields a 2x2 matrix as the final output.
